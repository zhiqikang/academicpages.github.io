# Zhiqi Kang's personal site

Hey there, you are curious enough about me to actually find this place. I am more of a cognitive scientist by training, focusing more on the psychology/neuroscience side. Have a look at the site https://zhiqikang.github.io/ for my work as well as my blog. Hope you would have fun here.

I have indeed zero clue about websites, so I used [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/), a Github Pages template for academic websites, which was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), and which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. A big thank you to those heroes.
