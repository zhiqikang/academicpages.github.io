This is my personal site, using [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/), a Github Pages template for academic websites, which was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. 

At this very moment, it is still under construction.
