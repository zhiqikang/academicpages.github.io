Hey there, glad you found me here.

I am a master student at Berlin School of Mind and Brain, Humbodlt-Universität zu Berlin. I am working with Dr. Ulf Tölch at QUEST center at Berlin Institute of Health as a student assistant. I plan to join Dr. Bernhard Spitzer at Max Planck Institute for Human Development in May 2018. Check out [CV](https://zhiqikang.github.io/cv/) for details of the things I have done, or contact me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/zhiqikang).

What else do I want to do with this site?

This is very much still a tentative personal site. As for the moment I am considering uploading some [study notes](https://zhiqikang.github.io/notes/), as well as starting a [blog](https://zhiqikang.github.io/year-archive/). I am also looking to sharpen my skills by replicating others' experiments and analysis scripts, and then share them here.
